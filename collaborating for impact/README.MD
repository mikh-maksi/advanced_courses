## Collaborating for Impact 
### Description:
Collaborating for Impact aims to support students in developing effective collaboration skills in the pursuit of collective impact and success. Few problems are solved by individuals working alone, therefore the ability to work effectively with others to achieve a common goal is a crucial professional skill. 
The course will start by focusing on the social awareness and relationship management components of Emotional intelligence, which were briefly introduced in the pre-requisite course, Optimizing Your Learning. Students will then be introduced to a variety of collaboration and leadership theories and frameworks, and they will examine theories of team dynamics and dysfunction, and reflect on how these relate to their past experiences of collaboration in academic and personal settings. 
The second part of this course will require students to put their communication and collaboration skills to practice by completing a group project that is designed to test their ability to work effectively as a group and deliver a high-quality output under time, resource, and information constraints.   
### Learning Outcomes:
